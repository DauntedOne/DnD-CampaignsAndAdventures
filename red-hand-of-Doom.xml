The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an action. The hand vanishes if it is ever more than 30 feet away from you or if you cast this spell again.
You can use your action to control the hand. You can use the hand to manipulate an object, open an unlocked door or container, stow or retrieve an item from an open container, or pour the contents out of a vial. You can move the hand up to 30 feet each time you use it.
The hand can&#39;t attack, activate magical items, or carry more than 10 pounds.</text><sclass>Bard</sclass><sclass>Sorcerer</sclass><sclass>Warlock</sclass><sclass>Wizard</sclass><sclass>Fighter (Eldritch Knight)</sclass><sclass>Rogue (Arcane Trickster)</sclass></spell><spell><name>Shocking Grasp</name><school>5</school><time>1 action</time><range>Touch</range><v>1</v><s>1</s><duration>Instantaneous</duration><text>Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to touch.

The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this spell again. 
	If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a scream. It can be your voice, someone else&#39;s voice, a lion&#39;s roar, a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before the spell ends. 
	If you create an image of an object, such as a chair, muddy footprints, or a small chest, it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The image can&#39;t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. 
	If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature.

The image appears at a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual, it isn&#39;t accompanied by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. 
	You can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. 
	Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.

When the bottle gnome is filled, It can be ordered to administer the potion to an adjacent ally. This does not take up an action.</text></item><item><name>Figurine of Wondrous Power, Onyx Dog</name><text>Rarity: Rare
A figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn&#39;t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn&#39;t become a creature.
The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions. See the Monster Manual for the creature&#39;s statistics, except for the giant fly.
The creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can&#39;t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine&#39;s description.
Onyx Dog.
This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has dark vision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can&#39;t be used again until 7 days have passed.

The target is grappled (escape DC 16) if the behir isn&#39;t already constricting a creature, and the target is restrained until this grapple ends.
	
Grappled:
• A grappled creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	
• The condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated.
	
• The condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.
	
Restrained:
• A restrained creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have disadvantage.
	
• The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.</text>	<attack><name>Constrict</name><atk>10</atk><dmg>2d10+6+2d10+6</dmg></attack>

</action><action><name>Swallow</name><text>The behir makes one bite attack against a Medium or smaller target it is grappling. If the attack hits, the target is also swallowed, and the grapple ends. While swallowed, the target is blinded and restrained, it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside the behir, and it takes 21 (6d6) acid damage at the start of each of the behir&#39;s turns. A behir can have only one creature swallowed at a time.
	If the behir takes 30 damage or more on a single turn from the swallowed creature, the behir must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw at the end of that turn or regurgitate the creature, which falls prone in a space within 10 ft. of the behir. If the behir dies, a swallowed creature is no longer restrained by it and can escape from the corpse by using 15 ft. of movement, exiting prone.
	
Blinded:
• A blinded creature can&#39;t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have disadvantage.
	
Prone:
• A prone creature&#39;s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.
	
• The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
	
• An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.
	
Restrained:
• A restrained creature&#39;s speed becomes 0, and it can&#39;t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have disadvantage.

	The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost&#39;s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.

The ghost can&#39;t be targeted by any attack, spell, or other effect, except ones that turn undead, and it retains its alignment, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and immunity to being charmed and frightened. It otherwise uses the possessed target&#39;s statistics, but doesn&#39;t gain access to the target&#39;s knowledge, class features, or proficiencies.
	The possession lasts until the body drops to 0 hit points, the ghost ends it as a bonus action, or the ghost is turned or forced out by an effect like the dispel evil and good spell. When the possession ends, the ghost reappears in an unoccupied space within 5 ft. of the body. The target is immune to this ghost&#39;s Possession for 24 hours after succeeding on the saving throw or after the possession ends.
	
Incapacitated:

<item><name>Potion of Fire Breath</name><text>Rarity: Uncommon
After drinking this potion, you can use a bonus action to exhale fire at a target within 30 feet of you. The target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The effect ends after you exhale the fire three times or when 1 hour has passed. This potion&#39;s orange liquid flickers, and smoke fills the top of the container and wafts out whenever it is opened.

While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast the magic missile spell from it. For 1 charge, you cast the 1st-level version of the spell. You can increase the spell slot level by one for each additional charge you expend.

The wand regains 1d6 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand&#39;s last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.</text><sclass>Artificer</sclass><sclass>Bard</sclass><sclass>Cleric (Trickery)</sclass><sclass>Sorcerer</sclass><sclass>Wizard</sclass><sclass>Rogue (Arcane Trickster)</sclass></spell><spell><name>Invisibility</name><school>6</school><level>2</level><time>1 action</time><range>Touch</range><v>1</v><s>1</s><m>1</m><materials>an eyelash encased in gum arabic</materials><duration>Concentration, up to 1 hour</duration><text>A creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.

If the webs aren&#39;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature restrained by the webs can use its actions to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
The webs are flammable.

The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point for the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure their area.
If the webs aren&#39;t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls or trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured web collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your next turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.
Each creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained as long as it remains in the webs or until it breaks free.
A creature restrained by the webs can use its actions to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no longer restrained.
The webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire burns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that starts its turn in the fire.</text><roll>2d4</roll><sclass>Druid (Underdark)</sclass><sclass>Sorcerer</sclass><sclass>Wizard</sclass></spell><spell><name>Disguise Self</name><school>6</school><level>1</level><time>1 action</time><range>Self</range><v>1</v><s>1</s><duration>1 hour</duration><text>You make yourself, including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person, look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it.

When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.
	
Invisible:
• An invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured. The creature&#39;s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.
	
• Attack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature&#39;s attack rolls have advantage.

The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.
	This potion&#39;s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a stone giant.
