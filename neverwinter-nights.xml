    <title>Session 6: Neverwinter Bridge and the Yuan-Ti</title>
    <text>
    Party members of this session: Little Crow, Fairuza, Quinthya, Moras

Date 12th of Spring, 66016

Only 1 threat is left: the bomb underneath one of the three Neverwinter Bridges (the Sleeping Dragon, the Winged Wyvern, the Dolphin)
The only information the party had, was that at the end of today the bomb would explode.
While Fairuza bought a small rowing boat, Morass went to find some used nets.
The first bridge that the group investigated was the Sleeping Dragon. The PCs found resistance from 6 Fire Knives, who were on the look out for anyone trying to disarm the bomb.
While battling the Fire Knives, two Blood Sailors showed up, both grafted with swords in the same way Sherry was grafted.
The Blood Sailors were both extremely hardy. A “killing blow” did not always stop them.
A captured Fire Knive revealed that there were similar teams at the Winged Wyvern and the Dolphin.
Better prepared than at the Sleeping Dragon, the PCs quickly identified the Fire Knive Wizard at the Winged Wyvern. After a quick battle, Quinthya found the bomb.
Retrieving the bomb went easily enough. It was loaded unto the rowing boat, pushed out to sea and brought to explode.
Date 13th of Spring, 66016

Taking a long rest, the PCs contemplated where the Blood Sailor hideout would be. Going through the belongs on Sherry again, Quinthya came up with the location of the hideout.
A sack of prumes, a musty smell on Blood Sailors, a walking cane grafted unto one of the Blood Sailors. It could only be the Neverwinter Home for the Elderly!
The Neverwinter Home for the Elderly basement yielded an acces way to an older building that was built, long before the Home for the Elderly was built.
Within it, the missing Yuan-Ti was using the bodies of Wailing Death victims to graft weaponry upon them and use them as a small army
The Yuan-Ti tried to put up a fight, but was eventually knocked unconscious.

    <title>Session 5: Next up in theaters: "The Girl and her Eyeball Familiar"</title>
    <text>
        - The party of three, Quinthya, Fairuza and Himo Starflower, set their eyes upon the Neverwinter Theater and the coming robbery there.
        - Quinthiya put dressed up as a theater worker and accessed the Neverwinter theater via the workers entrance. Through here she gained access to the access bridges and pully systems above the stage
        - Fairuza talked with the head security of the Neverwinter Theater, but was unable to convince him that something was afoot.
        - Himo took stock of all the exits: one larger entrance at the front for guests, one smaller employees entrance, one actors entrance
        - There were several stewards and guests that were acting suspicious. With some keen perception, investigation and stealthy encounters the Fire Knives were all identified, bound and delivered to the head of security.
        - All stolen wares were returned to their rightful owners, while the head of security proclaimed this was due to him and his team
        - While walking back to the Moonstone Mask, the PCs heard people screaming and fleeing a nearby square.
        - On that square was a strange Sherry/Mr. Snickles amalgamation; the body of Sherry, but with short swords grafted to here lower arms and Mr. Snickles grafted on as a head. The Sherry/Mr. Snickles monster was attacking and killing people, while trying to "search for Mr. Snickles".
        - With great effort, both physically and mentally, the PCs defeated the Sherry/Mr. Snickles amalgamation. Investigation showed that swords and Mr. Snickles were grafted to Sherry on points were she was also affected by the Wailing Death. Aside from a Potion of Healing, she also carried a sack of dried prumes.

        ### What was good during this session

        - The Neverwinter Theater was fun and a welcome break from combat. All three players concurred

        ### What could have gone better

        - Quinthiya: gain more experience with roleplaying. Things like what can I do? And what not?
        - Himo: no experience with gridlike battle
        - Fairuza: sad to not have much to do during the Neverwinter Theater
        - Fairuza: (still) in favor of enemies with more health and lower damage

        ### What the players are most curious about

        - What is going to happen at the Neverwinter Bridges?
        - Whether Lady Aribeth is evil? She is suspect by Quinthiya
        - What is the deal with the grafting and Sherry. Will there be a monster with a Sherry head?

    <text>
- Quinthya, Zaldar and Fairuza visited Jenkins, the former butler of Meldanen.
- In return for the garantuee to be transported somewhere safe, Jenkins offered the key to the backdoor of Meldanen's home, along with the hint to "look around the basement". Fairuza sent Jenkins with Cyar Tanash, a yuan-ti and sent him through an Arcane Gate to a safeplace.
- Outside the house of Meldanen was Sherry, who lost Mr.Snickles, her Eyeball familiar. After a quick search, Mr. Snickles was found.
- Inside the house of Meldanen, two Gnoll guards were dispatched
- In the basement were a range of strange creatures, captured and kept in cells by Meldanen.
- Meldanen was defeated, the Dryad was completely distraught by his death (probabily due to Stockholm Syndrom)
- Actions taken after deafeating Meldanen:
    - The City Guard have released all the prisoners and prisoned creatures and gave  medical attention to those who needed it
    - The City Guard are dividing all the food found in Meldanen's basement. Food has been distributed to the citizens of the Blacklake district.

    - Everyone mentioned in the Meldanen Admisitration is sued on charges of slave trade
    - The Dryad returned to her Groove, but promised to keep in touch with Fairuza
    - A message was sent back to Cyar Tanahash to return Jenkins, to sue him as an accomplice of Meldanen
- Starting with finding the Yuan-Ti in the docks, the PCs are surprised to see Sherry, who has lost her Eyeball familiar Mr. Snickles, again.
- While talking with Sherry, a body fell from roof.
- The killer tried to escape, but was captured by the PCs. He is a member of the Fire Knives and could explain that their opposition, the Blood Sailors, have opened an all out war on them. Unless the Fire Knives pay-up 100,000 GP at the end of this week, the Blood Sailors will hunt them down and kill them to the man.
- The captured Fire Knive has revealed two quests:
    1 Neverwinter Theater; prevent the guests from the Neverwinter Theater to be robbed
    1 Neverwinter Bridge; there is a bomb underneath of one of the three bridges of Neverwinter

What was fun:
- Dryad met Stockholm syndroom
- Mini games tussendoor; Skill Challenges ++; Puzzel and Traproom; Investigation
- Tempo, weinig momenten niks aan het doen
- Tussendoor doelen behalen, iedere sessie doel

    <title>Session 3: Defeat the Intellect Devourer</title>
    <text>
- Fairuza, Zaldar and Kraz (who was in the prison for destroying a dragon statue, which he thought was a real dragon) have defeated the Intellect Devourer. The Devourer had taken over the Warden, who was left catatonic, and resisted capture.
- Fairuza and Zaldar took two days rest. ŒFairuza started an investigation to the Wailing Death. Tissue samples of diseased people didn’t respond to any regular treatments, leading her to think the disease is magical in nature.
- Entering Blacklake district, the adventurers heard a cry of help from a woman, she was being attacked by a thug.
- Another thug tried to surprise Fairuza, but failed. A battle ensued and the woman was revealed to be the leader of the two thugs, as it was an ambush.
- After defeating these would be assassins, it was revealed they carried descriptions of the party members, along with a short description of their specialties.
- An investigation to the Blacklake district was started. Fairuza covered the swaps, where it was found that it is now filled with dumped Wailing Death victims.
- The food shortage is due to a rich merchant called Meldanen.
- Sherry, a girl across from Meldanen, revealed he never enters or leaves through his front-door. She finds Meldanen creepy and doesn’t trust her neighbor.
- Sherry saw Meldanen’s butler leave with his suitcases, she thinks he was fired at the start of this week.
- Jenkin’s house is a smaller home. He has boarded up his ground floor windows.

Positief:
- Encounter in the alley was fun as it had some story to it

Negatief:
- Intellect Devourer encounter was too bland. The Devourer itself wasn’t very powerful, the Bandit captain was too powerful.

    <text>
- Quinthya, Fairuza, Moras and Crow took care of Bandit Captain down in the sewers. Interrogation didn't reveal anything new.
- The prison was charged, using stealth and tactical movement. Two guards were quickly put down.

- Quinthya, Fairuza, Morass and Crow each recieved 200 XP.
- No loot was found.

      - when the Pcs reach ARibeth, she is in discussion with Desther. He believs it was wrong to trust "young whelps" and he believes to PCs will be too late. Aribeth says to trust that the PC believe that they can do good and they should believe in them.

Biography of Zaldar Mensk

Zaldar was born around 25 years ago, in a quiet town at the outskirts of Nesmé. His parents were humble farmers. His father Warmund Mensk lived in the farmhouse all his live, it was their family heritage. Warmund never had an exciting life, working hard and trading his stocks in the nearby city of Nesmé. In the city he noticed a woman named Kaila. It was love at first sight. Not soon after their married and had a baby boy they named Zaldar after came 2 more children Zarah, a girl and Bord a boy. Warmund never knew his wife possessed magical powers. She was in fact a sorceress. But she hid this fact in fear of rejection. Because she met a lot of people who feared the raw magical power she could wield. As she feared, one of her children possessed the same magical prowess, Zaldar.

The early years of Zaldar life went by quietly. Around the age of 8 the first signs of his abilities emerged. Which consisted mainly of things catching fire randomly. At first the people didn’t though it was Zaldar’s doing. But as the years gone by, they suspected him more and more. They grew wary of him. And the other children in town shunned him. So he began to feel alone, he became an outsider. He was desperate for some attention form the people in town and from the other children. He started pulling pranks. Which they didn’t appreciate. The other children stated to bully him. On one night when he was 12 years old, he was chased by some kids after he tried to set fire to one’s hair. They chased him into and old farmhouse, when they cornered him all hell broke loose. He was so afraid a giant amount of magical energy bursted form him. Setting fire to the whole house and blowing all the children away. When the fire died down the whole farmhouse was gone and most of the children managed to get out, except for one. The whole town blamed this death on Zalder and it was time he left. Kaila knew this would happen as it happened to her too. So she fled with him and took him to a school to train, so he could constrain his own power. She had made some inquiries, so the school would accept Zaldar.

He trained there for a couple of years, but he grew bored. As it was a wizard school they focused on study and acquiring knowledge though books. Zaldar wanted to train his powers by using them, growing bored on the endless reading of arcane tomes. So he did what he liked best, pulling pranks to kill time. Sneaking through the school messing with other people’s business. He even learn to lockpick. So he could steal stuff from other students rooms and planted the items on other. So he could watch the spectacle unfold. One night he wanted to pull the biggest prank yet, he broke into the office of the headmaster and stole his spellbook, when the headmaster was sleeping. But afterwards he didn’t knew what to do with it, so he burned it. Eventually they found out, which resulted in banning him from the school.

So he had nowhere to go to. They rejected him in his old town everybody in the school was mad at him. So he did what he was doing all his life. But this time he wasn’t just pulling pranks, he started to steal, because he needed to eat too. Using the spells which he learned at school. These weren’t his best days stealing from people through deception and breaking in to steal food. When time passed he felt wrong, he didn’t want to pass the rest of his live in the gutter.

Lukily Tjorven found him. Zaldar saw him one day at the market wearing a colourfull robe and emanating a magical aura. He was preforming for a crowd with a huge array of magical spells. Later the evening he followed him to a tawernand pleaded to him to take him in and train him. Eventually he succeded. The next couple of year Tjorven was like a mentor to him, training him in all the aspects of magic. Finally he managed to control his power fully. Tjorven also taught him about the world, its flaw and ideals. He gave Zaldar a sense of justice and morals.

Feeling grief for his previous actions, he wanted to help people now he controlled his powers. So Tjorven sent him to Neverwinter to join the hero’s academy to redeem himself and gaining more power in the process.
Although he controls his powers now for the first 20 years of his life the magical energies have run rampart through his head. Which left it’s mark, some may say that he is insane. He just thinks he’s different. Having trouble concentrating and sometimes having problems realising the results of his actions. If he thinks people deserve punishment, he will let fate decide if he should act. He will flip a coin to see if they deserve punishment.

Fearing the reaction of people about the fact that he is a sorcerer he is carrying a spellbook to  impose as a wizard.

When Kaila droped Zaldar at the school she gave him a ring, saying “It will help you on your way, when you need it the most”. Zaldar never realised what this meant. He kept the ring and kept it on a chain around his neck. He noticed a magical radiance emanating from the ring, but he never found out what it did. He never told anyone about this.

    Quinthya remembers nothing of her early years. She was told, before entering the monastary, that there was some kind of accident that killed her parents and little brother – Vakian. While prepapring a complicated potion. During her years in the monastary she learned about the history of her land. Days on end she would sit and meditate in silence, forgoing food and drink finding inner peace - but also discovering that in the history books she studied also lies a grave warning.

A great evil lurks in the East. Little is known about it, and connecting the dots has taken Quinthya many years. Quinthya's mentor, Grageon Glorygem, a Dwarf Monk, aka "Lord Grageon Glorygem the Unmatched", confirms her studies and notes that reports of this unknown evil have been circulating for the past 37 years - roughly the same number of years since Quinthya's parents died.

When in trance, Quinthya sometimes sees flashes of this unknown, great evil. An army stands before an enourmous vessel, a flying ship, made of metal with four large tentacles on the front and six smaller legs aft. While the ships fires beams of light that destroys everything in its path, a small person charges to the front to challenge it. Quinthya has come to realize that this person, this person is her.

Quinthya has left the monastary where she lived 2 years ago on a quest to find and eliminate this evil. More rumours are coming out of the east of mayhem and destruction, fueling Quinthya's desire to complete her quest and ultimately make her contribution the world. She has traveled to Neverwinter to enroll in the Heroes Academy in the hopes of finding powerful allies, and maybe friends, to accompany her on her quest.
